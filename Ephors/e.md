Sure! Here’s a structured write-up for your project, **Chief Cognitive Officer**:

## 1) Project Summary
**Chief Cognitive Officer (CCO)** is a revolutionary tool designed specifically for "vibe coders"—creative individuals who prefer a more intuitive approach over traditional virtual assistants. The CCO integrates seamlessly into Zoom meetings through a widget, providing real-time support and management tips to enhance the user’s ability to close deals. 

During meetings, the CCO assists users by generating relevant insights and suggestions based on the conversation, ensuring they remain engaged and effective. After each meeting, users can access a dedicated app where all meeting notes, a generated Product Requirements Document (PRD), and even a preliminary code repository are automatically created. This innovative tool allows vibe coders to quickly transition from discussion to action by launching their Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and building upon their generated resources.

Additionally, the platform facilitates collaboration by enabling users to train their CCO through integration with various services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Twitter, email, and calendars. The application further extends its utility by allowing users seeking vibe coders to browse profiles, conduct interviews, and hire the best candidates for their projects.

## 2) User Stories
- **As a vibe coder**, I want to use the CCO during Zoom meetings so that I can receive real-time tips on managing the discussion effectively.
- **As a vibe coder**, I want the CCO to generate meeting notes and a PRD automatically after a call, so I can focus on what was discussed without worrying about manual note-taking.
- **As a vibe coder**, I want to integrate my calendar and email with my CCO, so it can learn my preferences and provide personalized recommendations.
- **As a project manager**, I want to browse profiles of vibe coders, conduct interviews, and hire the right person for my project, so I can ensure the best fit for my team's needs.
- **As a vibe coder**, I want to quickly access a code repository created after my meetings, so I can start coding immediately based on our discussions.

## 3) Technical Implementation
- **Widget Development**: Create a Zoom widget using Zoom's SDK that interfaces with the CCO API to provide real-time feedback and suggestions during meetings.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Implement NLP algorithms to accurately analyze conversation content and extract key insights, which will assist the user in meeting management.
- **Backend Development**: Develop a robust backend using frameworks like Node.js or Django to handle user accounts, meeting data storage, and document generation (PRD, code repo).
- **Integrations**: Build APIs for integrating with Google Drive, Dropbox, Twitter, email services, and calendars to enable easy training of the CCO and data retrieval.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Design a user-friendly interface for the app that allows vibe coders to access their meeting notes, PRDs, and code repositories easily.
- **Profile and Hiring System**: Create a searchable database for users looking to hire vibe coders, complete with profiles, portfolios, and interview scheduling features.

## 4) Design Aesthetic
- **Visual Style**: Embrace a modern and minimalist design with a clean interface that prioritizes usability. Use soft color palettes (e.g., pastel colors) to create a calming and engaging environment for users.
- **Typography**: Choose clear and modern fonts for readability, ensuring that text is easily distinguishable during both meetings and in the app.
- **Iconography**: Incorporate intuitive icons that represent various features (e.g., notes, PRD, code repo) to enhance navigability and user experience.
- **User Flow**: Ensure a seamless user journey, from widget activation during meetings to easy access to post-meeting resources in the app. Use animations and transitions that feel organic and enhance interactivity without overwhelming the user.
