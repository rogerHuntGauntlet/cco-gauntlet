### Project Summary

**Chief Cognitive Officer (CCO)** is an innovative tool designed for "vibe coders" who prefer not to use virtual assistants, take notes, or manage meetings manually. The CCO integrates with Zoom meetings through a widget that provides real-time tips to manage and close deals effectively. Post-meeting, the CCO generates comprehensive meeting notes, a Product Requirements Document (PRD), and initiates a code repository, which users can further develop in their preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Users can personalize their CCO by connecting it to various external services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Twitter, email, and their calendar. Additionally, the platform allows potential clients to interview and hire vibe coders based on the performance and capabilities of their CCOs.

### User Stories

1. **As a Vibe Coder**
   - I want to join a Zoom meeting with the CCO widget installed, so that I can receive real-time tips on managing the meeting effectively.
   - I want to access post-meeting notes and a generated PRD, so that I can review the meeting's outcomes and start working on the project immediately.
   - I want to train my CCO by integrating it with my external services, so that it can provide more personalized and relevant suggestions.

2. **As a Potential Client**
   - I want to browse through available vibe coders and their CCOs, so that I can find the best match for my project.
   - I want to interview the CCOs to assess their capabilities, so that I can make an informed hiring decision.
   - I want to hire a vibe coder directly through the platform, so that I can streamline the recruitment process.

### Technical Implementation

- **Zoom Integration**: Develop a widget that seamlessly integrates with Zoom, allowing real-time interaction with the CCO during meetings.
- **Real-time Processing**: Implement algorithms to analyze meeting dynamics and provide actionable tips to the vibe coder.
- **Post-Meeting Processing**: Develop a backend system to generate meeting notes, PRDs, and initiate code repositories based on meeting data.
- **External Service Integration**: Create APIs to connect with Google Drive, Dropbox, Twitter, email, and calendars, allowing for data import and personalized CCO training.
- **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly app interface where users can access all CCO features, including post-meeting resources and the ability to start coding in their IDE.
- **Hiring Platform**: Build a platform where potential clients can browse, interview, and hire vibe coders based on their CCO performance.

### Design Aesthetic

- **Minimalist and Modern**: The CCO app should have a clean, modern interface that appeals to tech-savvy users. Use a monochromatic color scheme with subtle accents to maintain a professional yet engaging look.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Ensure that all features are easily accessible with clear labels and icons. The user journey from meeting to post-meeting resources should be seamless.
- **Widget Design**: The Zoom widget should be non-intrusive yet visible, with a sleek design that fits well within the Zoom interface.
- **Personalization**: Allow users to customize the look and feel of their CCO interface to match their personal or brand aesthetics, enhancing the user experience.

This comprehensive approach ensures that the Chief Cognitive Officer not only meets the needs of vibe coders but also provides a platform for clients to find and hire the best talent for their projects.
